          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Ren Sakamoto was born in Kyoto and raised in a family of traditional 
            craftspeople, where the scent of hinoki wood, the sound of metal 
            chisels, and the indigo vats of textile dyers were all part of 
            everyday life. His father restored machiya townhouses, and Ren 
            spent much of his childhood sketching their latticed windows and 
            tiled rooftops. His grandmother, a calligrapher from Osaka, taught 
            him to appreciate the balance between simplicity and 
            intention—lessons that shaped his artistic vocabulary early on.
            
            As a teenager, Ren became captivated by the textures and rhythms of 
            handmade objects: the cool weight of ceramic cups, the softness of 
            hand-dyed cloth, the patina of carved wooden talismans. He later 
            studied industrial arts in Tokyo, where he blended traditional 
            Japanese aesthetics with contemporary functionality. Today, Ren 
            works from a quiet studio in the northern foothills of Kyoto, 
            surrounded by shelves of ceramics, bamboo brushes, wind chimes, 
            textiles, and lacquered trays. His work reflects the understated 
            refinement of Japanese craft, with a focus on form, balance, and 
            natural materials.

          <h3>What inspires this collection</h3>
          <p>
            Treasures of Japan is Ren’s ode to the everyday beauty found in 
            Japanese life—from the peaceful rituals of morning tea to the red 
            gates of ancient shrines. Pieces like the Azure Wave Sake Set and 
            Sakura Evening Tea Bowl express his love of traditional pottery, 
            drawing on influences from Hokusai’s wave motifs and the soft pink 
            glow of Kyoto’s spring blossoms. Textile works such as the Shibori 
            Indigo Furoshiki and Indigo Noren Doorway Curtain reflect his 
            fascination with indigo dyeing, a craft he learned from artisans 
            in Tokushima who taught him the patience behind each fold, knot, 
            and dye bath.

            Many items in the collection carry a sense of movement and gentle 
            nostalgia. The Kintsugi Moon Plate celebrates imperfection and 
            renewal, while the Ukiyo-e Fan Wall Art and Tokyo Street Lantern 
            draw from Edo-era woodblock prints and the glowing lantern signs 
            of Tokyo alleyways. Sculptural objects like the Kokeshi Sisters 
            Duo, Red Torii Desk Shrine, and Kyo Machiya Incense House speak 
            to his lifelong connection to Japan’s architecture and folk 
            traditions. Through this collection, Ren hopes to share pieces 
            that feel both rooted in history and deeply personal—small objects 
            that carry calm, craftsmanship, and a moment of Japan into everyday 
            spaces.
