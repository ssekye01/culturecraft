          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Julien Moreau grew up between Paris and the small coastal town of 
            Saint-Malo, splitting his childhood between zinc rooftops and windy 
            Atlantic cliffs. His parents ran a corner café near Montmartre, and 
            he spent slow afternoons sketching customers, chipped café bowls, 
            and the changing light over the rooftops outside. Summers were for 
            visiting grandparents in Provence and Brittany, where sunflowers, 
            lavender fields, fishing boats, and lighthouses quietly worked 
            their way into his sketchbooks. Trained in illustration and ceramics, 
            Julien is drawn to objects that feel both lived-in and timeless—like 
            something you might inherit from a grandparent’s kitchen or discover 
            in a flea market. Today, he uses soft, nostalgic color palettes and 
            gentle, storybook details to capture everyday scenes of French life 
            in a way that feels intimate and welcoming.

          <h3>What inspires this collection</h3>
          <p>
            The Parisian Heritage collection is Julien’s tribute to the small 
            moments that define how he experiences France—morning coffee in a 
            café bol, twilight walks along the Seine, and salty breezes on the 
            Breton coast. Pieces like the Paris Rooftops Evening Canvas Print 
            and the Paris Rooftop Nightlight echo the view from his parents’ 
            apartment, where chimneys, glowing windows, and the distant Eiffel 
            Tower created a nightly skyline of warm lights and cool slate blues. 
            Works such as the Café au Lait Bol Set and Parisian Café Espresso 
            Set celebrate the ritual of breakfast in a neighborhood café, while 
            the Côte d’Azur Coastal Print Tray and Brittany Coastal Ceramic 
            Plate recall summers spent between bright umbrellas, sailboats, 
            and rugged shorelines. The Provence Sunflower Pottery Vase and 
            Provence Lavender Honey Jar draw directly from the colors and 
            textures of his grandparents’ farmhouse—sunburnt terracotta, 
            pale stone walls, and fields humming with bees. Together, these 
            pieces weave his memories of cafés, coastlines, and gardens into 
            a collection that invites people to bring a quiet slice of French 
            everyday life into their own homes.
