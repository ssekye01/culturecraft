              CultureCraft is a concept marketplace that spotlights artists whose work
              is rooted in their cultural identity. It’s designed to feel more like a
              gallery than a catalog — a place where you slow down, explore, and learn.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- Mission -->
          <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>
              Many online marketplaces flatten cultural work into anonymous products.
              CultureCraft imagines a different experience: one where you move through
              collections by culture, read the stories in the artists’ own words, and
              understand the traditions that shape each piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is a prototype, not a live store. It focuses on how layout,
              content, and visual design can work together so visitors feel invited to
              pause, read, and connect with the art in front of them.
            </p>

            <h2>How CultureCraft is structured</h2>
            <div class="about-grid">
              <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Curated collections</h3>
                <p>
                  Pieces are grouped by culture or theme — for example textiles, ceramics,
                  or festival traditions — so browsing feels focused instead of
                  overwhelming.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Artist stories</h3>
                <p>
                  Each collection is anchored by the people behind the work: short bios,
                  notes on process, and the cultural context that informs every piece.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="about-card">
                <h3>Marketplace view</h3>
                <p>
                  A shop-style layout brings everything together with clear pricing and
                  simple filtering, while still keeping the artist’s name and culture
                  front and center.

              In a fully developed version, CultureCraft could connect with real artists,
              integrate secure checkout, and support multilingual experiences. The core
              idea stays the same: a marketplace that treats culture with care and gives
              visitors time to read before they click “buy.”
