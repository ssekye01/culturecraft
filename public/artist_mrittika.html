          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Mrittika Rahman grew up in Old Dhaka, where narrow lanes echoed 
            with the sounds of rickshaw bells, temple conch shells, and the 
            rhythmic tapping of craftsmen shaping clay in roadside workshops. 
            Her mother, a schoolteacher from Barisal, often brought home 
            hand-molded pots from village markets, and these everyday objects 
            sparked Mrittika’s fascination with texture, storytelling, and the 
            warmth of terracotta. As a child, she would spend evenings watching 
            local artisans sculpt idols for Puja festivals, absorbing their 
            techniques and the narratives woven into each figure.

            After studying fine arts at the University of Dhaka, Mrittika 
            combined her formal training with the folk styles of southwestern 
            Bangladesh, where terracotta carving has deep historical roots. 
            She is especially drawn to the expressive simplicity of rural 
            life—the curve of a boat on the river, the flowing drape of a 
            sari, or the vibrant expressions of Baul musicians. Today, her 
            studio in Dhaka is filled with earth tones, wooden tools, and 
            trays of red clay sourced from Kushtia and Bogura, which she 
            shapes into contemporary renditions of age-old Bangladeshi motifs.

          <h3>What inspires this collection</h3>
          <p>
            The Clay Tales of Bengal collection is Mrittika’s homage to the 
            stories carried by the soil of Bengal—tales of songs, harvests, 
            rivers, and community. Pieces like the Baul Singer Figurine and 
            Boat Procession Panel celebrate the musical and riverine heritage 
            of rural Bangladesh, capturing moments of joy, rhythm, and 
            collective movement. Her Ganga Fisherwoman Lamp honors the labor 
            and resilience of women who work by the riverside, while works 
            such as the Harvest Day Wall Plate reflect her deep admiration 
            for the agricultural traditions that sustain village life.

            Mrittika often incorporates alpana-style borders and floral motifs, 
            visible in creations like the Alpana Motif Coasters and Lotus Ghat 
            Incense Holder, blending domestic artistry with spiritual symbolism. 
            She sees terracotta as a medium that carries memory—of mud under 
            one’s feet during monsoon, of festival nights lit by clay lamps, 
            and of boats gliding across quiet canals. Through this collection, 
            she seeks to preserve these small but enduring moments, offering 
            viewers a sense of home, heritage, and the timeless beauty of 
            Bangladeshi craft.
