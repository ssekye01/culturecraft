          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Adeola grew up between Lagos and Ibadan, where festival processions, 
            talking drums, and beadwork were part of everyday life. Trained in fine art, 
            she combines classical painting with design details drawn from Yoruba regalia 
            and architecture. Her early exposure to artisans in local markets shaped her 
            sense of color and texture, and she often credits her grandmother’s storytelling 
            for inspiring her focus on cultural memory. Today, Adeola works at the intersection 
            of tradition and contemporary design, using her practice to preserve and 
            reinterpret Yoruba visual language for a global audience.

          <h3>What inspires this collection</h3>
          <p>
            The Yoruba collection is Adeola’s love letter to ceremony and gathering.
            Pieces like the Oshun River Goddess Canvas, Market Day in Ibadan, and 
            the Yoruba Drum Circle Night Scene capture the warmth of shared music, 
            storytelling, and spiritual spaces. Repeating motifs — cowrie shells, 
            double axes, beaded crowns — are her way of honoring elders’ stories 
            while presenting them in a contemporary, gallery-ready way. Adeola 
            also draws inspiration from natural rhythms, especially the movement 
            of water and firelight, which she sees as symbols of guidance and 
            renewal. Together, these elements form a collection that celebrates 
            resilience, joy, and the continuity of Yoruba heritage.
